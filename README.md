# STEPBible is...    
A Charitable Incorporated Organisation registered in the UK #1193950 run by Bible scholars and computer enthusiasts, as well as members who help to decide priorities.   
The datasets are based on work by scholars at Tyndale House - an international Biblical Studies research institute in Cambridge, UK (see www.TyndaleHouse.com)   

The repository aims to provide reliable and freely usable data for studying the Bible without any denominational or doctrinal bias. Much of the data is based on other publically licenced sources, and has been compared with non-public sources so that differences can be checked by Tyndale scholars. Corrections and proposed updates are welcomed - please send them to STEPBibleATgmail.com for checking.  

# Datasets available 
The data is available as **[downloadable tab-separated text files](https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data/)** (see notes on the data format below).
The following datasets are already posted 

* **[Bible modules for OSIS Sword software](https://public.modules.stepbible.org/packages)**
Bibles in the same format as [Crosswire modules](https://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/) which can be used in any Sword-compatible software.

Semantic tags using the disambiguated Strongs is backwardly compatible with simple Strongs tags and includes all affixes (as defined in TBESH).

Greek text that includes all the words in NA27/28, TR and other major editions (SBLGNT, Treg, Byz, WH, THGNT). Each word is marked with the editions that contain it, positional variants, and meaning variants. All words and meaning variants are tagged lexically (disambiguated Strong linked to LSJ) and morphologically (Robinson based on Tauber with missing details) plus context-sensitive translations Punctuation is based on THGNT with spellings from NA28 or other editions for words not in NA27/28.       

* **[TBESH - Translators Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Hebrew in Github data](https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data/tree/master/Lexicons)** or **[Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o8kq_RFR1yg-RJsaije3rp0XiFOJygyfyXf4EOlEtWU/edit)**

Brief definitions for all Greek Bible words (NT, LXX, Apoc, & variants) using corrected Abbott-Smith when available, completed with other similar definitions. Backwardly compatible with original Strongs.  

* **[TFLSJ - Translators Formatted full LSJ Bible lexicon up to G5624 in Github data](https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data/tree/master/Lexicons)** or **[Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wbWm5FhUgcS8aBZ1s2u0cmnWKO7t-CuzE0ZaKsBtRpw/edit) with [Extra entries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T4nUbF65wXMN1fP6yeZ_ZPiDub63qFJHIOaNRlBSle8/edit)**      
Full LSJ entries for all Bible words (NT, LXX, Apoc & variants), formatted for easy reading (all bibliographic data hidden as hover-text) linked to extended Strongs (backwardly compatible with original Strongs).     

* **[TIPNR - Translators Individualised Proper Names with all References in Github data](https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data)** or **[Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ye5ujH_YutNfz1yYy7aiM_TBz3vMVACPpqKgNz0iH0Y/edit)**
Every proper noun in the Bible, linked to all Hebrew & Greek forms of that name and separated into individual people & places & things. Each form of the names includes exhaustive refs where that individual is named. Each person has data of their parents, partners, siblings and offspring and places places have geolocation (based on OpenBible). Every individual has a description in brief, short and article length (created by Claude 3 AI)   

* **[TVTMS - Translators Versification Traditions with Methodology for Standardisation: Eng+Heb+Lat+Grk+Others in Github data](https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data)** or **[Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mxUu7HJ5DScA7wOQLd-qFUMuG_MHnWjM6KxJ79qQs9Q/preview)**
All the versification differences in the OT traditional texts in Hebrew, Latin and Greek, and NT early versification, compared with English standard (defined by NRSV which is virtually identical to KJV). Bible translations have an almost infinite variety of versifications because they may follow (for example) Latin in several sections, Hebrew in a few and English most of the time. The Methodology provides simple rules for every section, such as "if this chapter has 29 verses, it is using Greek versification". Using this, a whole Bible can be reversified according to English or traditional Hebrew or Greek or Latin versification, or compared with Bibles using that versification.   

* **[TEHMC - Translators Expansion of Hebrew Morphology Codes](https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data)**  
Hebrew morphology codes with expanded explanations in terms of parsing, meaning and example. The codes are based on OpenScripture which is similar to the Westminster code system used in BibleWorks and other commercial software. They include extra codes which occur in STEPBible data which distinguishes sequential perfectives, gentilics, gender/location for personal pronouns, and non-Jussive/Cohortative as well as Jussive/Cohortative & possibly-Jussive/Cohortative forms.

* **[TEGMC - Translators Expansion of Greek Morphology Codes](https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data)**  
Greek morphology codes with expanded explanations in terms of parsing, meaning and example. The codes are based on Robinson, developed for the Majority text and used in most open-source texts. They include extra codes which occur in STEPBible data which distinguishes persons in possessive and reflexive pronouns, 2nd forms of verbs, and distinctions between deponant forms and ambiguous passive/middle.

# Datasets coming

If you see data that you have need of which isn't yet available, please contact us and perhaps you can become part of the checking process.  

* **TAGOT - Translators Amalgamated Greek OT**   
LXXo (oldest texts from Rahlfs), LLXn (newer texts from Sweet), LXXe (ecclesiastic texts based on Apostolic Bible which used Sixtine, Aldine and Complutensian texts). All tagged to LSJ using disambiguated Hebrew numbers for names only in the OT, both backwardly compatible Strongs. Morpology based on CCAT which is extended to text that isn't in Rahlfs.    

* **TFBDB - Translators Formatted full BDB lexicon**

* **TOTMM - Translators OT Manuscripts and Meanings**  
Translation, Hebrew form and witnesses for each variant that affects the meaning of the text, as determined by Barthélemy's UBS committee. Also, alternate meanings found in standard translations. Shown as alternate renderings of a base text (ESV).    

* **TNTMM - Translators NT Manuscripts and Meanings**  
Translation, Greek form and witnesses up to 400 AD for each variant that affects the meaning of the text, as determined by the UBS apparatus. Also, alternate meanings found in standard translations. Shown as alternate renderings of a base text (ESV).   

* **TBCWG - Translators Biblical Concept Word Groups **

# Data format 
Data is in plain unicode text (UTF-8) with fields separated by tabs, so that they can be loaded into any text editor or spreadsheet.   
  
* **To open in spreadsheets**, (e.g. Excel): In Github, click on the file, then "Download" then Save (Ctr+S) to your drive. In Excel "Browse" for it using "All Files" (not "All Excel Files") and open it. When asked, select "Unicode UTF8", "Delimited", "Tab", "General". 
  
* **By default, datasets are one-line records**, so a Record ends with a NewLine, and each line has identical fields.  
  
* Some datasets have multi-line records. Records are separated by a line starting with "$". The first line is a Header with fields that apply to each subsequent subRecord line. SubRecord lines all start with a tab.   
For example, in the ProperNames dataset, the first line is a header with information about the type (individual, place, title etc) and other data. These details apply to each of the subsequent subRecords which contain fields for the specific tag, Hebrew/Greek, translation, and the list of references. So the Header effectively contains fields which belong to each of its subRecords and would be  identical for each of them if they were included on each line.   
  
* **Hebrew glyphs** are separated and normalised in the order:    
  consonant; sin/shin dot; dagesh; vowel; metheg/raphe; accents  
  - Glyphs NOT used for Hebrew include:  
  װ ױ ײ ﭏ ײַ שׁ שׂ שּׁ שּׂ אַ אָ אּ בּ גּ דּ הּ וּ זּ טּ יּ ךּ כּ לּ מּ נּ סּ ףּ פּ צּ קּ רּ שּ תּ וֹ בֿ כֿ פֿ ﬠ ﬡ ﬢ ﬣ ﬤ ﬥ ﬦ ﬧ ﬨ   
* **Greek glyphs** are normalised to include only:
