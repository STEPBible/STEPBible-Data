Tyndale House is an international Biblical Research Institute housing about 50 scholars at a time, often from more than a dozen countries. 
The data in this repository is created and curated collaboratively by Tyndale scholars, directed by David Instone-Brewer with the oversight of Peter Williams, and by their successors. 

The repository aims to provide reliable and freely usable data for studying the Bible without any denominational or doctrinal bias. Much of the data is derivative from other publically licenced sources, and has been compared with other non-public sources so that differences can be checked by Tyndale scholars. Corrections and proposed updates are welcomed - please send them to TyndaleStep@gmail.com for checking.
