BRIEF LEXICAL MORPHOLOGY CODES: 
================
These codes are used in the Lexicon. They are used to define the the word, and not each individual instance of the word.

Form is:   Language:Function-Gender-Type
Example: "a Samaritan" is "N:N-M-LG" where "N:" is a "Name" (a special form of 'language' because it isn't restricted to one language); "N" is the function "Noun"; "M" is "Male"; "L" is Location, G=Gentilic (i.e. defining a group of people). 
Some traditional Strong numbers refer to more than one word, e.g. G1508= "εἰ μή" which is "G:COND + G:Neg" (note the space either side of "+")
Some refer to single words that are formed by merging words, e.g. G2504= "κἀγώ" which is G:Conj+G:P      (note no space either side of "+")
Some words have alternate morphologies for different uses,     e.g. G0894= "wormwood" is  G:N-F / N:N--T      (note the spaces either side of "/".) The first is the Noun "wormwoed" and the second is the Name of star. (The double "--" occurs because this Name does not have a gender.)
The following forms occur in the NT:
