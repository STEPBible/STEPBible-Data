1) Condensed Version - each section with the Tests to identify the versification being followed, and comparison of numbering in different traditions. This version is easy for humans to understand
2) Expanded Version - verse-by-verse renumbering to Standard versification with explanatory notes for each verse. This version is easy for use in software to Standardise a Bible or to add notes about Standard versification to a Bible
     (this version is found below, after the Condensed version and is followed by some more discursive notes)

1) CONDENSED VERSION

FIELD DESCRIPTIONS:
==============
This datasets has multi-line records divided by "$===========". The first line is a Header with Tests that apply to each subsequent subRecord line. SubRecord lines all start with a tab. 
References are recorded in the form of Chap:Verse.Subverse, e.g. Gen.6:1.2 is the second subverse of Gen.6:1 which can also be written as Gen.6:1b. 

The columns headed "English", "Hebrew", "Latin", "Greek" and others contain the equivalent versification for Bibles in these traditions. English is determined by NRSV, Hebrew by MT, Latin by Vulgate, Greek by LXX
Additional columns ("Other") are versions which do not conform to any of these traditions. For example, "Slavonic" follows the Greek tradition except for two passages (Lev.14:55-14:57; Jos.5:14-6:27). 
Additional "undivided" columns are supplied for texts where extra text has not been divided into subverses. 
Some editions of Hebrew, Latin or Greek texts have variations which may conform exactly with another tradition (such as English); if they do not conform with any other tradition their pattern is placed in an additional column. 

Subverses occur when text is added to verses in some Bibles, making a "LongVerse". The text that occurs in that verse in all Bibles is called subverse '0'. Additional verses are called subverse '1', '2' etc. 
        For example, the moving of 6 verses from Jos.8:30-35 to follow Josh.9:2 in Greek Bibles results in the text of Jos.9:2 being numbered Jos.9:2.0 and the moved text being numbered Jos.9:1-6
       These occur at Exo.28:22; Jos.9:2; 1Ki.2:35; 2:46; 5:14; 6:1; 8:53; 9:9; 10:22; 10:26; 12:24; 16:28; Est/Esg.1:1; 3:13; 4:17; 5:1; 8:12; 10:3

"Absent" means that there is a verse in Standard versification that has no text, so when creating a Standard Bible, this verse number has to be created, with a footnote saying that some Bibles have no text here. 
"NoVerse" means that there happens to be no such verse in this version nor in many Standard Bibles, so when creating a Standard Bible  there is no need to create the verse number or a footnote


TEST: 
These examine the points at which the traditions are different. They can be used to determine which tradition is being followed in a specific Bible. 
English Bibles follow mostly the Hebrew tradition, with some differences. Because so many Bibles and most commentaries follow this same set of differences, 
English standard is defined by the NRSV which is virtually identical to KJV: it divides 3Jn.14 to create the extra verse 15; and it put the final phrase of Rev.12:17 ("And he stood on thje sand by the sea") into v.18 (Some Bibles eg ESV put this at the end of v.17; most Bibles eg KJV, NIV have it at the start of 13:1; a few Bibles eg HCSB, NLT, follow NRSV and put it in a new v.18)
East-European or Orthodox Bibles tend to follow the Greek traditions, and West-European or Catholic Bibles tend to follow the Latin tradition. Jewish translations tend to follow the Hebrew tradition. 
However, many Bibles employ a mixture of traditions by following English, Hebrew, Latin or Greek traditional versification for different sections of the Bible. 

Each section has at least 4 columns:  versification numbers in the Standard English, traditional Hebrew, traditional Latin and traditional Greek (and occasionally others)
A Bible is following the numbering in a specific column if the tests above that column are TRUE for that Bible. They may be true for more than one column if these have identical versification. 
* REF.1:30=Last	is TRUE if the Bible has exactly 30 verses in chapter "REF.1"
* REF.1:30=Exist	is TRUE if the Bible has a verse numbered 30 with text in it
* REF.1:30.2=Exist	is TRUE if the Bible has at least 3 subverses in REF.1:30 (the verse that appears in all Bibles is subverse 0)
* REF.1:30=NotExist	is TRUE if the Bible does not have a verse numbered 30 with text in it (and there IS text in the previous verse, if this isn't v.1 - i.e. this chapter didn't end earlier)
* REF.1:30.2=NotExist	is TRUE if the Bible has fewer than 2 subverses in REF.1:30
* REF.1:30>REF.1:29	is TRUE if the Bible has more words in REF.1:30 than in REF.1:29 (this test is designed with enough leeway to work for whatever language the Bible is written in)
* REF.1:30<REF.1:29	is TRUE if the Bible has fewer words in REF.1:30 than in REF.1:29 
* REF.1:30<REF.1:29*2	is TRUE if the Bible has fewer words in REF.1:30 than twice the number of words in REF.1:29
* REF.1:30<REF.1:29.0	is TRUE if the Bible has fewer words in REF.1:30 than in the subverse '0' (i.e. the text which is found in all Bibles, whether or not subverses are added) 
	(subverse 0 is identical to the text found in all Bibles. Additional text that occurs in some Bibles is put into subverse 1 onwards. There are no tests for the length of those subverses because the text may not be divided into subverses)


ALIGNMENTS:
Different types of alignment are created by various situations: 

OT: 
Concatenation	occurs when an English verse merges more than one verse in another Bible, e.g. Exo.28:29
DuplicateTarget	occurs when an English verse contains only part of a verse in another Bible e.g. Gen.50:22-23
OneToOne	occurs a difference causes all subsequent verses are displaced , e.g. Num.12:16-13:33
LongVerse	refers to a section of LXX or Vulgate which is inserted into Standard versification as a series of subverses, e.g. 1Ki.6:1.0-4 (subverse "0" is the normal text of the verse, and 1-4 are additional subverses) 
LongVerseElsewhere	occurs where text has been moved into a LongVerse elsewhere, e.g. Jos.8:30-35
LongVerse/LVElsewhere	occurs where a LongVerse has been created by moving text from elsewhere, e.g. Jos.9:2 
LongVerseDuplicated	occurs where text has been duplicated in a LongVerse elsewhere, e.g. 1Ki.12:23
LongVerse/LVDuplicated	occurs where a LongVerse has been created by moving text from elsewhere, e.g. 1Ki.12:24
LongVerse/LVExtra	occurs where a LongVerse has been created by adding text to the text, e.g. Est/Esg.1:1. These may alternatively occur as extra chapters. 
TextMayBeMissing	occurs where some ancient versions do not include any words, e.g. Neh.7:68
StartDifferent	occurs where verse divisions can occur in slightly different positions, e.g. Num.26:1
[= REF]	indicates an alternate way to refer to the same verse in the same Bible


NT: 
TextMayBeMissing	occurs where some ancient manuscripts do not include any words in a verse, e.g. Mat.12:47
PassageMoved	occurs only at Rom.16:25-27 which is found at Rom.14:24-26 in some manuscripts 
Colophon	occurs at the end of epistles, which have a verse about provenance in some manuscripts, e.g. 1Co.16:24
PassageMissing	occurs at the start of passages that are missing in some manuscripts, i.e. Mrk.9:20 & Jhn.7:53-8:11 (& 1Jn.5:7b-8a which does not alter any versification)
StartDifferent	occurs where verse divisions can occur in slightly different positions, e.g. Rev.13:1 
Concatenation	occurs when one verse merges more than one verse in another Bible, e.g. 3Jn.1:14-15]

Occasionally the differences result in a change to verse order. This is marked by an asterix in the top row, e.g."Greek*". This occurs only in Latin "Sir" and in Greek at  Exo.20:13-15; 21.16-17; 35:8-27; 37:1--38:31; 39:32-42; 40:30-31; Num.1:24-25; 10:34; 26:15-47; Jos.24:31; 1Ki.3:1; 4:20-21, 25-28; 6:1; 7:1-12, 21, 25; 9:16, 23-25; 11:5-8; 22:46-49; Jer.31:37; 49:7-39; Ezk.7:3-5; Mal.4:6; (using English verse numbers)
Note: the section "Gen.5:31-6:1" is placed after Malachi for the sole reason that it is the most complex instance of differences, and someone starting to grapple with this data is likely to give up if it is the first one they come across.

FIELD DESCRIPTIONS:
==============
SourceType	This isn't used in programming but is useful for checking. It is the type of Bible versification being followed on this line, and selected by the Tests at the end.
SourceRef	This is a verse number in a Bible being tested and/or converted. 
StandardRef	This is the equivalent verse number in a Standard Bible IF the tests at the end are TRUE
Action	This is what you do with the text in the verse found in the Source (See "How to use this" below)
Importance & NoteMarker	"Nec" = Necessary note because the verse number has changed. "Acd" = useful in Bibles used by academics who want to know all differences in ancient Bibles. "Ped" = Pedantic list of changes - eg a separate note on every verse in Baruch, Susanna & Ep Jeremiah. 
	"[1]" etc are suggested markers for the note. It is normally the verse number of the most important alternate version. The chapter number is included if it is different to the chapter in the StandardRef
NoteA & Note B 	This is the text of a note that is suited to that version of the Bible at that verse in the StandardRef. Note B contains a second sentence used in some notes. They use standard phrases (listed at the end) bounded by "%" to aid replacement by translated phrases.
Ancient Versions 	This is a list of the refs as occurring in traditional Hebrew, Latin & Septuagint editions.  It is only useful in Bibles used by academics. 
Tests	These tests have to be TRUE. If they aren't, move on to the next line. There's a section at the end doesn't have any tests, so it applies to that verse in every Bible version. 

See notes at the end on how it works, but briefly, for the line: 
Gen.32:1	Gen.31:55	Renumber verse	Nec. [32:1]	%In some Bibles the verse numbering here is% 32:1.		(Hebrew=32:1 • Latin=31:55 • Greek=31:55)	Hebrew	Gen.32:33=Last	
This means: 	
at Gen.32:1: if Gen.32:33=Last (ie if v.33 is the last verse in Gen.32) then:
* renumber the verse as Gen.31:55
* add a note: [1] "In some Bibles the verse numbering here is 32:1 (Hebrew=32:1 • Latin=31:55 • Greek=31:55)"

How to use this: 
===========
Col.1 has the type of source Bible that this line concerns. It is there to make these lines more readable. It is not needed for coding.
Col.2 has the verse number in the Bible being tested. If this verse exists AND the test(s) in the last col are TRUE, then the Action in col 4 is required
Col.3 has the equivalent verse number in Standard Bibles. If this is the same as Col.2 then no renumbering occurs. An optional note explains that some other Bibles have different verse numbering. 
Col.4 has the action to take when marking up a Bible: 
 - Keep verse = the text retains the same verse number. The note is "Acd" (Academic) - ie it is optional because it has information that is useful for scholars. 
 - Renumber verse = the text remains the same but the verse number changes. If the StandardRef is a subverse (ending in ".1", ".2" etc) then the text is appended to what is already in that verse. The note is "Nec" ie it is needed to explain the change
 - Empty verse = Create an empty verse with this number, because this Bible does not have any text in that verse. The note is "Nec" - ie it is needed to explain that it is empty. 
 - Merged with = Create an empty verse with this number, because this Bible merges the text of this verse with another. The note is "Nec" - ie it is needed to explain this. 
Col.5 has the suggested marker for the note, eg "[2]". This should be at the start of the verse because it is often the verse number that it had before renumbering. If it was not renumbered, it is the verse number in the most important source that is different from the Standard verse number.
Col 6 & 7 have the sentences that make up a note to insert in this verse. %...% marks out a phrase that can be translated. 
Col.8 has the refs in standard ancient editions. This is useful information for scholarly who need to mention these alternates when they cite a verse. 
Col.9 has the conditions that need to be True for this line to apply 

Summary of how to implement actions. 
================
1) Create an empty Bible with the Standard number of verses for each chapter (see below). These verses are the "StandardRef" 
     Each verse in the Source Bible is the "SourceRef" 

2) For each line, if the Tests = True, carry out  the following Actions: 
* "Renumber verse - Nec."	If the SourceRef exists: Cut the text from its position in SourceRef and paste it into the STATED StandardRef AFTER any text that his position may already contain. Prefix this pasted text with a note containing Note A & Note B 
* "Keep verse - Nec." 	If the SourceRef exists: Cut the text from its position in SourceRef and paste into the IDENTICAL StandardRef AFTER any text that his position may already contain.  Prefix this text with a note containing Note A & Note B 
* "Keep verse - Acd." 	If the SourceRef exists: as above, but without any note UNLESS this is an Academic Bible where the note(s) may be useful
* "Empty verse"/"Merged with"	(Even if the SourceRef does not exist): Do not copy or paste any text. Add the note at the start of the StandardRef before any text which may (or may not) be present.

Notes: 	If the Standard Ref is a subverse, place the note and text AFTER any text that is already in present in the StandardRef. The order of lines will always be the same as the order of the subverses or merged text.
	The first Subverse number is normally  ".1", but on two  types of occasions they start with ".0": In the Psalms for Psalm Titles. Outside the Psalms it indicates the normal text of the verse when subverses are added  the normal text of a verse making a "LongVerse"
	Subverses may begin as ".1" or ".0". When ".0" occurs in the Psalms it is used for Psalm Titles. Outside the Psalms, subverse ".0" is the standard content of that verse, to which subverses are added in some Bibles. 
	If the BIble is for academic use, include the Ancient Versions after every note - eg. "(Hebrew= -- • Latin=Dan.13:27 • Greek=Sus.1:27)". These can be omitted for other Bibles. 

3) When this is finished, for any SourceRef that still contains text: 
	Cut the text and paste it into the identical StandardRef. Add no note.    (If there is already some text in this StandardRef, then an error has occurred.)




EG for the line:
Hebrew	Gen.32:1	Gen.31:55	Renumber verse	Nec. [32:1]	%Normally in this Bible the verse numbering here is% 32:1.		(Hebrew=32:1 • Latin=31:55 • Greek=31:55)	Hebrew	Gen.32:33=Last	
This means: 	
at Gen.32:1: if Gen.32:33=Last (ie if v.33 is the last verse in Gen.32) then:
* renumber the verse as Gen.31:55
* add a note: [1] "In some Bibles the verse numbering here is 32:1 (Hebrew=32:1 • Latin=31:55 • Greek=31:55)"

And: 
Greek	Exo.21:17	Exo.21:16	Renumber verse	Nec. [17]	%Normally in this Bible the verse numbering here is% 21:17.		(Hebrew=21:16 • Latin=21:16 • Greek=21:17)	Greek	Exo.21:16<Exo.21:17	
means at Exo.21:17, if "Exo.21:16<Exo.21:17" (ie if the number of words in v16 is less than the number in v.17) then renumber the verse and add a note. The difference is picked to be large enough so it will work in any translation. 

And: 
English+Latin	1Ki.6:38	1Ki.6:38	Keep verse	Acd. [1d]	%In some Bibles the verse numbering here is% 6:1d.		(Hebrew=6:38 • Latin=6:38 • Greek=6:1d)	English+Latin	1Ki.5:18=Last & 1Ki.6:38=Last & 1Ki.6:1<1Ki.6:6*2	
means at 1Ki.6:38, if "1Ki.5:18=Last & 1Ki.6:38=Last & 1Ki.6:1<1Ki.6:6*2" (ie the chapters end at these verses, and the word-count in v.1 is less than 2x the word-count in v.2) then leave the verse as-is and add the note. 

What this produces:
=============
If you renumber verses and add notes whenever the tests are True, this will produce a Bible where:
* Every verse number conforms to Standard versification
* If the verse number has been changed, it is followed immediately by the original verse number as a Footnote marker. 
* Every verse that is renumbered has a note explaining what has happend. 
* Every verse where ancient translations have different numbering, a note mentions this. This is often important when citing a verse. 

EG in JPS Gen.32:28 And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?' And be said: 'Jacob.'
Becomes: Gen.32:27 [28] And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?' And be said: 'Jacob.'
    note: [28]: Normally in this Bible the verse numbering here is 32:28 (Hebrew=32:28 • Latin=32:27 • Greek=32:27)

EG in ESV Gen.32:27 And he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.”
Becomes Gen.32:27 [28] And he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.”
    note: [28]: In some Bibles the verse numbering here is 32:28 (Hebrew=32:28 • Latin=32:27 • Greek=32:27)

If you want to produce a Bible with fewer notes, you can
* omit notes marked as "Acd." (Accademic)  and "Ped." (Pedantic) 
If you want to produce a Bible with shorter notes, you can
* omit the summary of ancient refs - ie the sections such as "(Hebrew=32:28 • Latin=32:27 • Greek=32:27)" which mainly for academics.

If you want to produce a Bible that does not change the verse numbers: 
* don't renumber the verses
* instead of the NoteMarker that is supplied, use the verse number of the StandardRef. 
* use the same note, as given

Psalm Titles
========
These are marked ".0" (eg Ps.51:1.0)  and the text of the first verse is marked as ".1" (eg. Psa.51:1.1 though in the StandardRef this is simply Psa.51:1) 
In Standard versification, the Titles (when they occur) are the first part of verse 1. However, they are normally formatted in italics, so it is useful if they are distinguished in some way from the rest of the verse. 
In ancient Hebrew, Greek and Latin texts, the Psalm titles are normally in their own verse(s). 
In most markups, the Title is formatted as Italic, and occurs before the verse marker for v.1. 
Occasionally a long Title may be split into  two verses in the source, in which case the contents of the second verse is also labelled ".0" (eg Psa.51:1.0). 
Outside the Psalms, ".0" has a different meaning - see "Subverses" re "LongVerse"

Subverses
=======
These are marked with decimal points (e.g. ".1", ".2") in SourceRef and StandardRef, and marked as letters ("a", "b") in human-readable sections - i.e. the note Marker and notes. 
A subverse in the StandardRef are always grouped together in sequence. 
In the StandardRef, the reference is given in a form that indicates whether to insert code for a new verse or for a new subverse. The first subverse is recorded with simply the chap:verse, to indicate that the code for a verse like any other verse is needed. Subsequent subverses are recoreded as chap:verse.subverse, to indicate the code for a subverse is needed. 
In most cases the first subverse is ".1" but in some cases the first subverse is ".0". This occurs in the Standardised version of Greek Bibles, eg at Jos.9:2 where 8:30-35 is inserted as subverses after the normal text of Jos.9:2 which is subverse ".0"

(The following lineup of subverse letters and numbers only works with a non-proportional font such as Courier)
a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z aa ab ac ad 
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 

EG at Dan.4:34.3 (which is only found in Bibles with subverses, eg editions of the Septuagint) "Dan.4:34=Last & Dan.3:97=Last & Dan.4:34.3=Exist" (ie if chaps 4 & 5 end at v.34 & 39, and if the subverse Dan.4:34.3 does actually exist) then renumber and add a note.

Some versions (esp. the Septuagint and translations of it) have lots of subverses. If they aren't separate in the source, then the tests that are True will follow the "GreekUndivided" scheme. 
So when you are testing for something like Dan.4:34.3, you are looking to see if there is a separate subverse like that. Of course, in some systems, the subverses might be labelled differently - eg. Dan.4:34c - in which case you'll have to conform the text with the rules (or vice versa)

Subverses also occur when the LXX moves verses (such as the last few verses of Josh.8) to another place (in this case, just after the text found in Josh.9:2). They are added as subverses at the new location, because if they were inserted as verses, all the subsequent verses would need renumbering. 
In this kind of situation, the normal text of Josh.9:2 becomes subverse ".0" and the inserted verses get numbered as subverses ".1"-".6" or "a"-"f". See the layout at  p.181 at http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/06-iesous-nets.pdf

There is no letter for ".0". When it is accompanied with other subverses, it is expressed as a comma, eg: "Jos.9:2, 2a-f", but if there are no subverses to indicate the verse itself has text separate from the subverses, a dot is used, eg "Jos.9:2٠"   (this dot is intended to be ignorable, and yet convey the information when necessary. It is an Arabic zero)        
The StandardRef does not have this dot - ie "Jos.9:2٠" is expressed as "Jos.9:2".  In these cases the first subverse is not at the start of the verse, so the "a" or ".1" is expressed, unlike with most first subverses. 


Notional Subverses
=============
This only occurs in the columns that intended only for humans to read (i.e. cols 5-8) and never in the cols needed for programming

It occurs, for example, when a single verse in the source Bible is split into two verses in Standard versification, eg: 
Greek	Exo.35:17	Exo.35:15	Renumber verse	Nec. [15-16]	%Normally in this Bible this verse and the next are merged into one verse that is numbered% 35:17.		(Hebrew=35:15 • Latin=35:15 • Greek=35:17a)	Greek	Exo.35:16<Exo.35:18	
Greek	Exo.35:17	Exo.35:16	Merged with	Nec. [17b]	%Normally in this Bible some text may be missing here because it is merged with% 35:15.		(Hebrew=35:16 • Latin=35:16 • Greek=35:17b)	Greek	Exo.35:16<Exo.35:18	
This results in the whole text for the two verses being put into Exo.35:15 leaving v.16, with nothing but a note explaining what has occurred. In the note, "a" means the first part of the verse, without any indication of where it ends. 

Rearrangements
===========
Subverses sometimes occur due to rearrangements of the LXX text - that is, parts of the text occur in a different order. We don't know the reason for this, but probably the LXX was translated from an early version of the Hebrew text where the exact order was not yet settled. 
One interesting place is Exo.20:13-15 where the order of some of the 10 Commandments is different, which may be reflected in Jer.7:9. The has yet another order (see https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=ESV%7Ctext=steal%20and%20adultery%20and%20murder&options=HVNUG&pos=1 )
Others in Greek Bibles: Exo.20:13-15; 21:16-17; 35:8-27; .37:1-29; .38:1-31; .39:1-43; .40:9-38; Num.1:24-37; 10:34-36; 26:1-47; Jos.8:30-9:2; 24:29-31; 1Ki.2:8-5:4; 7:1-51; 8:12-10:26; 11:5-8; 16:28; Jer.31:1-31:40; 49:1-49:39; Ezk.7:3-7:9; Mal.4:1-4:6
Some scholars will want to study these texts in the order in which they have been transmitted, but most work on the LXX depends on comparing the translations, for which it is more useful to have the Greek in the same order as the Hebrew, English and Latin. 
Rearrangements also occur in a couple of other places:
• Ben Sirah (or Sirach) has a couple of places in Latin where a few verses are in a different order: 7:9-11; 9:21-23; 10:21-24; 19:25-26; 32:9-11. These are sections of individual sayings, like proverbs, so the order doesn't make any difference to the sense. 
• Rom.14:23 - Byzantine MSS place the 'final' benediction here, though most editions place it at the end of the letter - where almost all translations put it. A notable exception is WEB - see https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=WEB%7Creference=Rom.14&options=VHNUG&pos=1

Orthodox and Latin 'extra' bits
===================
Lje (Epistle or Letter of Jeremiah) if it exists, is added to Baruch as ch.6 - as it is in NRSV
Man (Prayer of Manasseh) or Odes.12 becomes 2Chr.37 or the  end of 2Chr.36 in some Bibles.
Greek Daniel has three sections of extra bits that are extracted to become Bel, Sus, and S3Y (aka 'Song of Three Children/Youths' or 'Prayer of Azariah')
Greek Esther has six sections of extra bits that are added as subverses at 1:1; 3:13; 4:17; 5:1-2; 8:12; 10:3
 - thse routines will put the extra material into those subverses. 
If the Bible has two copies of Esther (ie one based on Hebrew, ending at 10:3 and one based on Greek/Latin with more chapters) then the one ending at 10:3 should be called 'Est' and the one with extra chapters should be named 'EsG'
- in this situation these routines will leave Est as-is and re-order EsG to put the extra material into extra chapters from ch.10:4- to ch.16
