FIELD DESCRIPTIONS:
==============

EStrong#	These Extended Strong Numbers are mapped to BDB (and thereby to other modern lexicons) by OpenScriptures.org. This adds about 800 words which are found in modern lexicons but were not differentiated by Strong. 
	Numbers beyond 9000 include non-lexical prefixes and suffixed. They were created by Tyndale House, Cambridge
	They are designed to be backward compatible with software that uses Strongs numbers. 

Gloss	These were created by Tyndale scholars

Hebrew form	These are based on BDB, then normalised. 

Morph	These were created by Tyndale scholars as a simple gramatical value of the main word represented as Language:Type-Gender-Extra. 
	Language:Type-Gender-Extra.   Language is A=Aramaic, H=Hebrew, G=Greek and n+Name (which is not language specific). 
	Type is A=Adjective, Adv=Adverb, Art=Article, Cond=Conditional, Conj=Conjunction, Cor=Correlative, DemP=Demonstrative Pn, ImpP=Impersonal Pn, Intg=Interogative, Intj=Interjection, N=Noun, Neg=Negative, Part=Particle, Prep=Preposition, PerP=Personal Pn, PosP=Possessive Pn, RefP=Reflexive Pn, RelP=Relative Pn, V=Verb. 
	Gender is F=Female, M=Male, N=Neuter, C=Common and P or S is optionally added for Plural Singular
	Extra for Names is L=Location, P=Person, LG/PG=Gentilic, T=Title (i.e. any other capitalised nouns such as titles, months, gods, planets etc)
(notes re Morph) 	Location is only used for places not named after people - eg: Israel = N:N-M-P (for the Person, and nation); Jerusalem = N:N--L; Canaanite is N:N-M-LG; Israelitess is N:N-F-PG
	Location is a geographical entity such as river, mountain or city eg "Dan", but Gentilic is used for Amon, Syria, Judah, or the tribal area of Dan. The idea is that someone from Dan is probably related to Dan unless he is called a Hittite, but someone from Jerusalem or the city of Dan could be from anywhere even though he is named after the city. So a "Shulemite" (who is prob from Salem ie Shalem aka Jerusalem) is dark-skinned and perhaps not a native from the area.
	Title is a misc category that incl names of gods, musical term & months and offices such as Pharaoh unless referring to an individual eg Pharaoh Necho who is N:N-M-P
	When F or M occ with L or T it refers to the gender of that person, not the location, so Jerusalem = N:N--L, Jerusalemites = N:N-G-L, Jerusalemitess = N:N-F-L 
	When Gentilics related to a person the STEP_LexicalTag points to the Person eg Danites => Dan.  When Gentilics point to a place, the STEP_LexicalTag points to that place, eg Gileadites => Gilead. When there is no numbered tag for the person or place, we probably aren't sure what it is, so the STEP_LexicalTag doesn't have anywhere different to point, eg. Girgashites. Some very common Gentilics (eg Levite) have gained a meaning of their own which may be related to a person but much less so - so the STEP_LexicalTag does not redirect to the entry for that person. 
	Odd ones: Jew=N:N-G-P, Jewish=N:A, Jewess+Ammonitess=N:N-G-P-F, Canaanite-trader=N:N-G-P / N:N-G-T, Chaldean-magi=N:N-G-L / N:N-G-T, Nephusim=N:N-G-T, Rephaim=N:N-G-P / N:N-G-T, Shulamite+Shunammite+Carmelitess+Jezreelitess=N:N-F-L

Meaning	These are based on the Abridged BDB by Online Bible, and edited to conform with the extended Strongs. They are for guidence only. Permission should be gained from Online Bible before these are applied in any project. 
	These defs refer to J. Green's A Concise Lexicon of the Biblical Languages (CLBL) and Harris, Archer, & Waltke's Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament (TWOT),)
	These definitions were edited to align with the augmented Strongs by Tyndale House Cambridge.
