BRIEF LEXICAL MORPHOLOGY CODES: 
================
These codes are used in the Lexicon. They are used to define the the word, and not each individual instance of the word.

Form is:   Language:Function-Gender-Type
Example: "a Samaritan" is "N:N-M-LG" where "N:" is a "Name" (a special form of 'language' because it isn't restricted to one language); "N" is the function "Noun"; "M" is "Male"; "L" is Location, G=Gentilic (i.e. defining a group of people). 
Some traditional Strong numbers refer to more than one word, e.g. G1508= "εἰ μή" which is "G:Cond + G:Neg" (note the space either side of "+")
Some refer to single words that are formed by merging words, e.g. G2504= "κἀγώ" which is G:Conj+G:PerP      (note no space either side of "+")
Some words have alternate morphologies for different uses,     e.g. G0894= "wormwood" is  G:N-F / N:N--T      (note the spaces either side of "/".) The first is the Noun "wormwoed" and the second is the Name of star. (The double "--" occurs because this Name does not have a gender.)
The following forms occur in the NT:

FULL MORPHOLOGY CODES:
================
These codes are used in the tagged texts. They are used to define each individual instance of the word.

line 1: Codes + expansion	- based on OpenScripture codes which are similar to Westminster codes used by BibleWorks and other commercial software. These codes are described in detail at https://goo.gl/HP4mZQ#HebMorph
	- some of the parsing is derived from the data in the codes: Stem implies the likely Action and Voice; Form implies the likely Tense and Mood. These are not definite and depend on context and the normal usage of each verb. See more at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQ67vPIrNxvICy5QmSeromQUJmePml1nQxv7n1gJ8qw/edit#bookmark=id.evqm50b2x4wq
	- the 1st character indicates Hebrew or Aramaic. When codes are strung together, this character becomes "/", e.g.   "HC/Ncmsa" 
line 2:              morphology 	- the morphology in a phrase that makes sense in English
line 3:              explanation 	- the meaning of this morphology in a phrase that makes sense in English 
line 4:              example	- an example of how a Hebrew or Aramaic word in this form might be translated, using: "Jew" for gentilics, "person/man/woman" for nouns, "late" for adjectives etc
	- verbs are based on רוּם (H7311A) which means, roughly: Qal= "to rise" (eg "I rise", "I am risen"); Piel= "to raise" (eg "I raise someone", "I am raised [by someone]"; Hiphil="to exalt" (ie "I cause to be raised")


THE ELEMENTS OF MORPHOLOGY:
Functions: 	Conjunction, Adverb, Preposition, Particle, Pronoun, Noun, Adjective, Verb, Suffix
	 - these are defined and parsed in line with OpenScriptures with a few embelishments - see the table at https://goo.gl/HP4mZQ#HebMorph
Stem: 	Aphel, Haphel, Hiphil, Hishtaphel, Hithpaal, Hithpael, Hithpeel, Hophal, Hothpaal, Ishtaphel, Ithpaal, Itpeel, Niphal, Nithpael, Pael, Peal, Peil, Piel, Pual, Qal, Shaphel, Tiphil
	(other minor forms are subsumed into these). For their interpretation https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQ67vPIrNxvICy5QmSeromQUJmePml1nQxv7n1gJ8qw/edit#bookmark=id.evqm50b2x4wq
Action, Determined by Stem: 	Simple, Intensive/resultive, Causative/declarative. 
	In explations these are "performing", "intensifying or achieving" and "causing or confirming" 
Voice, Determined by Stem: 	Active, Passive, Reflexive/iterative. 
	In explanations these are done "by", "to" and "to or for themselves by" 
Form - for non-verbs: 	different forms depending on Functions. See the table at https://goo.gl/HP4mZQ#HebMorph
 - for vebs: 	Participle, Participle passive, Infinitive, Imperfective, Sequential Imperfective, Conjunction+Imperfective, Perfective, Sequential Perfective, Imperative. 
	In explanations, Imperfective is "incomplete", Perfective is "complete" and sequential follows the 'completeness' of the previous verb. 
Tense, Determined by form: 	Future/present (for Imperf), Past/present (for Perf), Present/future (for Imperative), N/A (for Part, Infin). 
	In explanations, the most likely tense is listed first. 
Mood, Determined by form: 	Imperative, Cohortative, Jussive, Enacted (ie not Jussive or Cohortative or Imperative), Enacted/Cohortative, Enacted/Jussive (for ambiguous Imperfective form). 
	In explanations, "should" is used for cohortative and "may" for Jussive. 
Person: 	First, Second, Third. 
	In explanations these are "the one speaking or writing", "the one being addressed", "the one being discussed". 
Gender: 	Feminine, Masculine, Either. 
	For proper nouns: Feminine individual, Masculine individual, Location, Other title (includes names of months, ranks, divinities etc)
Number: 	Singular, Plural, Dual
State: 	Construct, Absolute (ie non-construct), Definite (ie includes an Aramaic determinate suffix - this will be replaced by Absolute or Construct in STEPBible tagging). 
	In explanation, a construct is "a term combined with another"

NOTES: 
* Articles and Definite or Paragogic forms are referred to in explanations as "important". 
* Passive is determined by the Stem, but Participle Passive turns an Active stem into Passive. So Participle actives are recorded simply as Participle, because they can often take a passive voice. 
* Hothpaal in some other systems is classified as Passive, but it is classified here as Reflexive. This occurs only rarely (Lev.13.55, 56 הֻכַּבֵּ֣ס ‘washed out’; Num.1.47; 2.33; 26.62 הָתְפָּקְד֖וּ ‘they were enrolled’; Deu.24.4 הֻטַּמָּ֔אָה ‘she has been declared unclean’; 1Ki.20.27 הָתְפָּקְדוּ֙ ‘they were3 mustered’; Isa.34.6 הֻדַּ֣שְׁנָה ‘it has fattened itself’). Normally this is passive, though it can have some reflexive undertones (esp. Isa.34.6). 
* Nithpael in some other systems is classified as equivalent to Reflexive, but it is classified here as Passive. It occurs only rarely (Deu.21.8 וְנִכַּפֵּ֥ר ‘and it will be atoned for’; Prov.27.15 נִשְׁתָּוָֽה ‘she is like’; Eze.23.48 וְנִֽוַּסְּרוּ֙ ‘and.they.will.be.warned’). All these instances are Passive (with the possible exception of Pro.27.15). 
* Hithpael in some other systems is classified as Intensive (or Resultative which is more typical for Hithpael), but it is classified here as Simple. This is difficult to decide because there is evidence for either side. Only a few verbs have meanings for Qal/Niphal sufficiently different to Piel/Pual to enable assigning the Hithpael clearly to one rather than the other. See more notes at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQ67vPIrNxvICy5QmSeromQUJmePml1nQxv7n1gJ8qw/edit#bookmark=id.79gmkybm2s9t
* "Enacted" means Indicative - ie not subjunctive (a form that has disappeared in Hebrew) or jussive or cohortative (forms that have disappeared in most verbs in Hebrew). In many cases of Imperfective, it is impossible to know if the form is Jussive/Cohortative or not, so it is marked Enacted/jussive or Enacted/cohortative. 
* "Sequential" verbs (aka consecutive or non-conjunctive) are prefixed with a vav which changes imperfective to perfective meaning and vice-versa. In general, a section begins with a non-sequential verb and may be succeeded by a number of sequential verbs till the end of the section. 
* "Conjunctive" verbs are prefixed with a vav as a conjunction, so it does not change the meaning of the verb. This is recognised by vowel changes in Imperfective verbs. It is rare with Perfective verbs and there is no difference in form by which to identify it, so this is done by context.
